Overview
--------


The develop tool is meant to allow you to make full game 
ROMs by providing tools to write code, edit sprites,
build backgrounds, and import sounds.

The UI consists of 3 parts, the menu bar, 
the view canvas, and the view switcher.

- The menu bar is a line of text buttons that give 
  additional features to manage the view. Located 
  at the top of the screen

- The view canvas has the tool features

- The view switcher switches between views using 
  button icons at the bottom of the screen.



View is GBA:
- 30 8x8 tiles wide
- 20 8x8 tiles high 

- 1 row is dedicated to menu (top)
- 1 row is dedicated to view switcher (bottom)

The canvas (layer 1) view 
-------------------------

 Layout:
    - left side is a scrollable view consisting of 
      all tiles. Each line is tile visual (1:1) in the palette
      color currently selected follwoed by a hex of its ID.
      One of them is always selected. Default is 0x0.
      
    - Middle is a view consisting of 2:1 tiles. The cursor is a 
      16x16 square snapped to 16x16 grid increments. If the pencil tool 
      is selected and the cursor clicked, the area highlighted is replaced 
      with the current tile + palette. If the erase tool is selected,
      the tile is removed.
      
      The region is scrollable using ctrl + drag and is effectively infinite.
      
      
    - Right side has 3 buttons:
        1. Pencil tool. Toggled on or off 
        2. Erase tool. Toggled on or off, opposite of pencil.
        3. Palette chooser. Opens a view to select a palette 
        
        
The canvas (layer 2) view 
-------------------------

Same as layer 1, except is stored separately 
and it shows layer 1 below it with a preset neutral palette.


The sprite view 
---------------

Shows canvas but has only one tile (4:1) area selected.

Layout:
    - left side becaomes scrollable region for palettes, same size 
      as the sprite selector for the canvas view 
      
    - Middle is 4:1 sprites in the grid layout of the canvas.
      The center is the sprite currently being worked on.
      Clicking places changes the pixel of the selected sprite
      with the selected area
      
    - right ride is 5 buttons corresponding to the "empty" color 
      and the 4 colors of the currently selected palette. They are buttons.
        
    - The button has 4 arrow buttons. Clicking changes which palette is 
      selected for editing on the canvas displayed. This means that 
      changing sprites to work on requires placing them on the canvas first.

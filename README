Sprite Entertaininment System
-----------------------------

The SES is a development kit and system to produce and play games 
with the look and feel of early generations of game consoles.


It is split into 3 parts:

ses developer:  The UI that generates and modifies ROMs.
ses: The player that, when given a ROM, allows for playing it 
ses debug: Similar to ses, but enables debugging features, which
makes it convenient to debug ROMs.


ROMS consist of different segments of binary data:
- Game bytecode that controls the game's logic
- Audio waveform data for audio samples
- Initial image data 
- Initial palette data

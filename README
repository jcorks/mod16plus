Sprite Entertaininment System
-----------------------------

THIS IS JUST A PREVIEW. Nothing is working yet!

The SES is a development kit and system to produce and play games 
with the look and feel of early generations of game consoles.





It is split into 3 parts:

ses developer:  The UI that generates and modifies ROMs.
ses: The player that, when given a ROM, allows for playing it 
ses debug: Similar to ses, but enables debugging features, which
makes it convenient to debug ROMs.


ROMS consist of different segments of binary data:
- Game bytecode that controls the game's logic
- Audio waveform data for audio samples
- Initial tile data 
- Initial palette data




Tile-based Rendering 
--------------------

Rendering is based on tiles, which are 5-bit images 
8x8 in size. Tiles are the visual primitive of the SES.

Each pixel of a tile can be 5 possible values:
0 -> Transparent 
1 -> Back color 
2 -> Mid-back color 
3 -> Mid-front color 
4 -> Front color

Where each are an index into the palette. The real, on-screen 
color comes from the palette, which is what defines the 
color used for each pixel when rendered.

There are 2 kinds of tiles:

. Sprite tiles. These are used render sprites,
  which consist of 1 tile that can be rotated, scaled, and translated.
  
. Background tiles. These are used for backgrounds, which are sets of 
  tiles all rendered simultaneously, which is useful for images greater 
  than 8x8. Backgrounds can only be translated.


The total number of possible tiles able to be 
stored is 524288 (0x80000). 262144 (0 - 0x3ffff) sprites are exclusive to backgrounds, 
and 262144 (0x40000 - 0x8ffff) are exclusive to sprites.

Tiles of any kind can be copied and moved around 
freely, so sprite tile memory can be used as "overflow"
or working tile memory.

Sprites
-------

A total of 4096 sprites may be onscreen at the same time.
Each sprite consists of 1 tile and can have transform effects
(position, rotation, scale) applied to it. This can be 
useful for particle effects, characters, anything thats 
more-or-less dynamic.

Sprites can use tiles from IDs 0 to 0x40000-1


Backgrounds
-----------

Backgrounds may be used to render collections of tiles 
simulaneously. This can be convenient for background visuals,
large images, and more. A total of 512 backgrounds may be 
defined and used.

Backgrounds are specifically collections of tiles in 
a predefined order. Backgrounds are 32 tiles wide and 
16 tiles tall, so theyre always the same dimensions. They 
pull from tiles from topleft, to the right, and down.
For example:

0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15
16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 ...
...

And so on.

Backgrounds only use background tiles, which start at 
tile ID 0x40000 and go until tile 0x80000-1

Effects
-------

All rendered tiles have multiple possible rendering effects.
The default is "Color mode" where each color of a pixel displayed
and the pixel "on top" is the one on-screen.
"Blending mode" will color based on adding color values together.

Masking is also available, which can control which pixels make it 
to the screen or not.


Layers
------

Each background and sprite have a layer upon which theyre drawn.
Layers are used to control the order in which things appear 
on-screen. Earlier layers are drawn first, with backgrounds drawn 
before sprites for each layer. Layers 0-31 exist for use.
